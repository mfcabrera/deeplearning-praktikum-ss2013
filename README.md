=====================

This repo contains some excercises solved during the summer semester for the
deep learning praktikum. This were the warmuop excercises but I couldn't
finish them all.

Contains thre directories :

- Multinomial logistic implementation
- Neural Network implementation
- PCA and Autoencoder (Autoencoder not implemented)


The other part of the code cannot be shared because of confidenciality
issues.
